Triangles is a coding example that gets information about right triangles in a grid. The grid has rows A-F 
and columns 1-12. Each non-hypotenuse side is 10 pixels.

The class that does the calculations for the triangles is Services/TriangleService. The home page has a simple 
JavaScript UI that uses the web API to exercise the triangle calculations.
